NAME
    App::UniqFiles - Report or omit duplicate file contents

VERSION
    version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
     # See uniq-files script

DESCRIPTION
    Warning: cannot properly handle symlinks or special files (socket, pipe,
    device), so don't feed them.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported, but they are exportable.

TODO
    *   Handle symlinks

        Provide options on how to handle symlinks: ignore them? Follow?
        Also, with return_duplicate=2, we should not use the symlink
        (because one of the usage of uniq-files might be to delete duplicate
        files).

    *   Handle special files (socket, pipe, device)

        Ignore them.

    *   Check hardlinks/inodes first

        For fast checking.

    *   Arguments hash_skip_bytes & hash_bytes

        For only checking uniqueness against parts of contents.

    *   Arguments hash_module/hash_method/hash_sub

        For doing custom hashing instead of Digest::MD5.
