NAME
    App::UniqFiles - Report or omit duplicate file contents

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of App::UniqFiles (from Perl
    distribution App-UniqFiles), released on 2014-05-16.

SYNOPSIS
     # See uniq-files script

FUNCTIONS
  uniq_files(%args) -> [status, msg, result, meta]
    Report or omit duplicate file contents.

    Given a list of filenames, will check each file size and content for
    duplicate content. Interface is a bit like the "uniq" Unix command-line
    program.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   check_content => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to check file content .

        If set to 0, uniqueness will be determined solely from file size.
        This can be quicker but might generate a false positive when two
        files of the same size are deemed as duplicate even though their
        content are different.

    *   count => *bool* (default: 0)

        Whether to return each file content's number of occurence.

        1 means the file content is only encountered once (unique), 2 means
        there is one duplicate, and so on.

    *   files* => *array*

    *   report_duplicate => *int* (default: 2)

        Whether to return duplicate items.

        Can be set to either 0, 1, 2.

        If set to 2 (the default), will only return the first of duplicate
        items. For example: file1 contains text 'a', file2 'b', file3 'a'.
        Only file1 will be returned because file2 is unique and file3
        contains 'a' (already represented by file1).

        If set to 1, will return all the the duplicate items. From the above
        example: file1 and file3 will be returned.

        If set to 0, duplicate items will not be returned.

    *   report_unique => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to return unique items.

    Return value:

    Returns an enveloped result (an array).

    First element (status) is an integer containing HTTP status code (200
    means OK, 4xx caller error, 5xx function error). Second element (msg) is
    a string containing error message, or 'OK' if status is 200. Third
    element (result) is optional, the actual result. Fourth element (meta)
    is called result metadata and is optional, a hash that contains extra
    information.

NOTES
    Warning: cannot properly handle symlinks or special files (socket, pipe,
    device), so don't feed them.

TODO
    *   Handle symlinks

        Provide options on how to handle symlinks: ignore them? Follow?
        Also, with return_duplicate=2, we should not use the symlink
        (because one of the usage of uniq-files might be to delete duplicate
        files).

    *   Handle special files (socket, pipe, device)

        Ignore them.

    *   Check hardlinks/inodes first

        For fast checking.

    *   Arguments hash_skip_bytes & hash_bytes

        For only checking uniqueness against parts of contents.

    *   Arguments hash_module/hash_method/hash_sub

        For doing custom hashing instead of Digest::MD5.
